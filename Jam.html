<h2>How to make a Brioche Bun Smeared with Grape </h2>
<h3>Compote and Legume Spread in 10 Hours</h3>
<p>Holly Marchlewski - March 26, 2014</p>
<blockquote>
	"If I asked you to list, in detail, all of the steps for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, what tasks would you state? Try it…

Did you include the specifics? How granular did you get?

For example, your task list might look something like this:

Clear an area on the counter for sandwich assembly
Gather one loaf of sliced Wonder brand whole grain bread
Gather Mr. Nutty’s all natural peanut butter
Gather one squeeze bottle of Smuckers grape jelly
Grab a butter knife
Untwist the tie on the bread packaging
Remove two slices of bread (skipping the unwanted heel)
Lie the two slices of bread on the cleared area of the counter side by side (one on the left and the other on the right) with large, flat side up
Open the jar of peanut butter
Use the butter knife to put approximately 2 tablespoons of peanut butter on one side of the slice of bread on the left
Set that slice of bread back on the cleared counter with peanut butter up
Pick up the other slice of bread
Squeeze approximately 1 tablespoon of jelly on the front side of the bread (not the crust edges)
Place the jelly side of that slice on top of the peanut butter side of the other slice with the tops and bottom edges aligned
Eat, already – you’ve worked hard!
Chances are the list above is different from yours. Perhaps you thought about a different brand of products. Or, perhaps you continued going into detail about how to cut the crusts off if you’re feeding a child (or yourself – I don’t judge!), or you outlined all of the clean-up tasks, and so on.
Some tasks on my list may have seemed so obvious they were unnecessary to list, but imagine what could have happened without the minutiae. If the details around using sliced, whole grain bread weren’t included, you could find yourself smearing peanut butter and jelly on top of an entire loaf of Italian bread! Now, hopefully quality testing (the sandwich eater, in this case) would reveal the errors, but re-work is costly."
